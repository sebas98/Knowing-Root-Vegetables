        <p> Our mission at “Knowing Root Vegetables” is to inform people on the importance of incorporating root vegetables into one’s diet. We aim to achieve this through several facets of information, such as history on certain root vegetables, ways they can be consumed, and the actual health benefits that they can provide. On top of this, we’ve provided a recipe for each of the featured root vegetables to encourage people to actively try them out. Many people are unaware that certain ingredients are even root vegetables to begin with, so our informational site addresses these misconceptions and may even introduce prospective home cooks to new ingredients. </P>
